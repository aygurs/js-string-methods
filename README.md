JSNuggets provides qn interactive solution to teach junior developers how to use string and array methods in JavaScript.

## How to Use
On the website you will be presented with an introductory paragraph, followed by the methods currently available to test.
Each method will be presented as: variable.method().
Your job is to enter arguments for the methods and see if the method still runs correctly. If you see no error, you've entered arguments the method can use to run correctly. If you're presented with an error message, congrats! You've found an error.

## Future Updates
The website will be updated further to include all string methods, and eventually array methods.

## Why I built this website
I wanted to test my skills with JavaScript and see if I could really code something that junior developers like me can use. It's not only a useful tool for others to see what errors can occur with methods, its also useful for me to know the ins and outs of methods that are used regularly.
